# RSS Poetry

Ocaml web server to distribute public domain poetry via RSS.

This is a personal/learning project.

## What does/will it do?

The idea is to get a daily poem from a classic poet in your RSS feed. Feeds are dynamically
generated based on the poem and the start date. Thus a `robert-frost/2021-03-01` feed accessed on
`2021-03-03` would include the first 3 poems from Robert Frost.

## Where can I see it?
