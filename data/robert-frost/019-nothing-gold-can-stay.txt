  <p>
    <span>Nature’s first green is gold,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Her hardest hue to hold.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Her early leaf’s a flower;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But only so an hour.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Then leaf subsides to leaf.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>So Eden sank to grief,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>So dawn goes down to day.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Nothing gold can stay.</span>
