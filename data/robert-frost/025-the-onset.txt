  <p>
    <span>Always the same, when on a fated night</span>
    <br/>
    <span>At last the gathered snow lets down as white</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As may be in dark woods, and with a song</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It shall not make again all winter long</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I almost stumble looking up and round,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As one who overtaken by the end</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Gives up his errand, and lets death descend</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Upon him where he is, with nothing done</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To evil, no important triumph won,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>More than if life had never been begun.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Yet all the precedent is on my side:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I know that winter death has never tried</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The earth but it has failed: the snow may heap</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In long storms an undrifted four feet deep</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As measured against maple, birch and oak,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It cannot check the peeper’s silver croak;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And I shall see the snow all go down hill</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In water of a slender April rill</span>
    <br/>
    <span>That flashes tail through last year’s withered brake</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And dead weeds, like a disappearing snake.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Nothing will be left white but here a birch,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And there a clump of houses with a church.</span>
