  <p>
    <span>Nothing to say to all those marriages!</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She had made three herself to three of his.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The score was even for them, three to three.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But come to die she found she cared so much:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She thought of children in a burial row;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Three children in a burial row were sad.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>One man’s three women in a burial row</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Somehow made her impatient with the man.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And so she said to Laban, “You have done</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A good deal right; don’t do the last thing wrong.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Don’t make me lie with those two other women.”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Laban said, No, he would not make her lie</span>
    <br/>
    <span>With anyone but that she had a mind to,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>If that was how she felt, of course, he said.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She went her way. But Laban having caught</span>
    <br/>
    <span>This glimpse of lingering person in Eliza,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And anxious to make all he could of it</span>
    <br/>
    <span>With something he remembered in himself,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Tried to think how he could exceed his promise,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And give good measure to the dead, though thankless.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>If that was how she felt, he kept repeating.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>His first thought under pressure was a grave</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In a new boughten grave plot by herself,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Under he didn’t care how great a stone:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He’d sell a yoke of steers to pay for it.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And weren’t there special cemetery flowers,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>That, once grief sets to growing, grief may rest:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The flowers will go on with grief awhile,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And no one seem neglecting or neglected?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A prudent grief will not despise such aids.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He thought of evergreen and everlasting.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And then he had a thought worth many of these.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Somewhere must be the grave of the young boy</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Who married her for playmate more than helpmate,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And sometimes laughed at what it was between them.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>How would she like to sleep her last with him?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Where was his grave? Did Laban know his name?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>He found the grave a town or two away,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The headstone cut with <i>John, Beloved Husband</i>,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Beside it room reserved, the say a sister’s,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A never-married sister’s of that husband,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Whether Eliza would be welcome there.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The dead was bound to silence: ask the sister.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>So Laban saw the sister, and, saying nothing</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of where Eliza wanted <em>not</em> to lie,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And who had thought to lay her with her first love,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Begged simply for the grave. The sister’s face</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Fell all in wrinkles of responsibility.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She wanted to do right. She’d have to think.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Laban was old and poor, yet seemed to care;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And she was old and poor⁠—but she cared, too.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They sat. She cast one dull, old look at him,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Then turned him out to go on other errands</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She said he might attend to in the village,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>While she made up her mind how much she cared⁠—</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And how much Laban cared⁠—and why he cared,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>(She made shrewd eyes to see where he came in.)</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She’d looked Eliza up her second time,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A widow at her second husband’s grave,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And offered her a home to rest awhile</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Before she went the poor man’s widow’s way,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She and Eliza had been friends through all.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Who was she to judge marriage in a world</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Whose Bible’s so confused in marriage counsel?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The sister had not come across this Laban;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A decent product of life’s ironing-out;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She must not keep him waiting. Time would press</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Between the death day and the funeral day.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>So when she saw him coming in the street</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She hurried her decision to be ready</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To meet him with his answer at the door.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Laban had known about what it would be</span>
    <br/>
    <span>From the way she had set her poor old mouth,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To do, as she had put it, what was right.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>She gave it through the screen door closed between them:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“No, not with John. There wouldn’t be no sense.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Eliza’s had too many other men.”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Laban was forced to fall back on his plan</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To buy Eliza a plot to lie alone in:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Which gives him for himself a choice of lots</span>
    <br/>
    <span>When his time comes to die and settle down.</span>
