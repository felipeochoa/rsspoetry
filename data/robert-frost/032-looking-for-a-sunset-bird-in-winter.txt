  <p>
    <span>The west was getting out of gold,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The breath of air had died of cold,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>When shoeing home across the white,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I thought I saw a bird alight.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>In summer when I passed the place</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I had to stop and lift my face;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A bird with an angelic gift</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Was singing in it sweet and swift.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>No bird was singing in it now.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A single leaf was on a bough,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And that was all there was to see</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In going twice around the tree.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>From my advantage on a hill</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I judged that such a crystal chill</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Was only adding frost to snow</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As gilt to gold that wouldnâ€™t show.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>A brush had left a crooked stroke</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of what was either cloud or smoke</span>
    <br/>
    <span>From north to south across the blue;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A piercing little star was through.</span>
