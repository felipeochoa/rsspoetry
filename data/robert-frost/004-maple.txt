  <p>
    <span>Her teacher’s certainty it must be Mabel</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Made Maple first take notice of her name.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She asked her father and he told her “Maple⁠—</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Maple is right.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="i6">“But teacher told the school</span>
    <br/>
    <span>There’s no such name.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="i9">“Teachers don’t know as much</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As fathers about children, you tell teacher.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>You tell her that it’s M-A-P-L-E.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>You ask her if she knows a maple tree.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Well, you were named after a maple tree.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Your mother named you. You and she just saw</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Each other in passing in the room upstairs,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>One coming this way into life, and one</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Going the other out of life⁠—you know?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>So you can’t have much recollection of her.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She had been having a long look at you.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She put her finger in your cheek so hard</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It must have made your dimple there, and said,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>‘Maple.’ I said it too: ‘Yes, for her name.’</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She nodded. So we’re sure there’s no mistake.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I don’t know what she wanted it to mean,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But it seems like some word she left to bid you</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Be a good girl⁠—be like a maple tree.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>How like a maple tree’s for us to guess.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Or for a little girl to guess sometime.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Not now⁠—at least I shouldn’t try too hard now.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>By and by I will tell you all I know</span>
    <br/>
    <span>About the different trees, and something, too,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>About your mother that perhaps may help.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Dangerous self-arousing words to sow.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Luckily all she wanted of her name then</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Was to rebuke her teacher with it next day,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And give the teacher a scare as from her father.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Anything further had been wasted on her,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Or so he tried to think to avoid blame.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She would forget it. She all but forgot it.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And came so near death in the dark of years,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>That when it woke and came to life again</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The flower was different from the parent seed.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It came back vaguely at the glass one day,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As she stood saying her name over aloud,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Striking it gently across her lowered eyes</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To make it go well with the way she looked.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>What was it about her name? Its strangeness lay</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In having too much meaning. Other names,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But hadn’t as it went. (She knew a Rose.)</span>
    <br/>
    <span>This difference from other names it was</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Made people notice it⁠—and notice her.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.)</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Her problem was to find out what it asked</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In dress or manner of the girl who bore it.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>If she could form some notion of her mother⁠—</span>
    <br/>
    <span>What she had thought was lovely, and what good.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>This was her mother’s childhood home;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The house one story high in front, three stories</span>
    <br/>
    <span>On the end it presented to the road.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.)</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Her mother’s bedroom was her father’s still,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Where she could watch her mother’s picture fading.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Once she found for a bookmark in the Bible</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A maple leaf she thought must have been laid</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In wait for her there. She read every word</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of the two pages it was pressed between</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As if it was her mother speaking to her.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But forgot to put the leaf back in closing</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And lost the place never to read again.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>So she looked for herself, as everyone</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Looks for himself, more or less outwardly.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And her self-seeking, fitful though it was,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>May still have been what led her on to read,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And think a little, and get some city schooling.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand may</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Have had to do with it⁠—she sometimes wondered.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>So, till she found herself in a strange place</span>
    <br/>
    <span>For the name Maple to have brought her to,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Taking dictation on a paper pad,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And in the pauses when she raised her eyes</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Watching out of a nineteenth story window</span>
    <br/>
    <span>An airship laboring with unship-like motion</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And a vague all-disturbing roar above the river</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Beyond the highest city built with hands.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Someone was saying in such natural tones</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She almost wrote the words down on her knee,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“Do you know you remind me of a tree⁠—</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A maple tree?”</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="i6">“Because my name is Maple?”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>“Isn’t it Mabel? I thought it was Mabel.”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>“No doubt you’ve heard the office call me Mabel.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I have to let them call me what they like.”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>They were both stirred that he should have divined</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Without the name her personal mystery.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It made it seem as if there must be something</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She must have missed herself. So they were married,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And took the fancy home with them to live by.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>They went on pilgrimage once to her father’s</span>
    <br/>
    <span>(The house one story high in front, three stories</span>
    <br/>
    <span>On the side it presented to the road)</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To see if there was not some special tree</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She might have overlooked. They could find none,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Not so much as a single tree for shade,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She told him of the bookmark maple leaf</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In the big Bible, and all she remembered</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of the place marked with it⁠—“Wave offering,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Something about wave offering, it said.”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>“You’ve never asked your father outright, have you?”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>“I have, and been put off sometime, I think.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>(This was her faded memory of the way</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Once long ago her father had put himself off.)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>“Because no telling but it may have been</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Something between your father and your mother</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Not meant for us at all.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="i10">“Not meant for me?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Where would the fairness be in giving me</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A name to carry for life, and never know</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The secret of?”</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="i6">“And then it may have been</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Something a father couldn’t tell a daughter</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As well as could a mother. And again</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It may have been their one lapse into fancy</span>
    <br/>
    <span>’Twould be too bad to make him sorry for</span>
    <br/>
    <span>By bringing it up to him when he was too old.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Your father feels us round him with our questing,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And holds us off unnecessarily,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As if he didn’t know what little thing</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Might lead us on to a discovery.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It was as personal as he could be</span>
    <br/>
    <span>About the way he saw it was with you</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To say your mother, had she lived, would be</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As far again as from being born to bearing.”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>“Just one look more with what you say in mind,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And I give up”; which last look came to nothing.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But, though they now gave up the search forever,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They clung to what one had seen in the other</span>
    <br/>
    <span>By inspiration. It proved there was something.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They kept their thoughts away from when the maples</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Stood uniform in buckets, and the steam</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of sap and snow rolled off the sugar house.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>When they made her related to the maples,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It was the tree the autumn fire ran through</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And swept of leathern leaves, but left the bark</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Unscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They always took their holidays in autumn.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Once they came on a maple in a glade,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And every leaf of foliage she’d worn</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Laid scarlet and pale pink about her feet.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But its age kept them from considering this one.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Twenty-five years ago at Maple’s naming</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It hardly could have been a two-leaved seedling</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The next cow might have licked up out at pasture.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Could it have been another maple like it?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They hovered for a moment near discovery,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Figurative enough to see the symbol,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But lacking faith in anything to mean</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The same at different times to different people.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept them</span>
    <br/>
    <span>From thinking it could be a thing so bridal.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And anyway it came too late for Maple.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She used her hands to cover up her eyes.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“We would not see the secret if we could now:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>We are not looking for it any more.”</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Thus had a name with meaning, given in death,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Made a girl’s marriage, and ruled in her life.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>No matter that the meaning was not clear.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A name with meaning could bring up a child,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Taking the child out of the parents’ hands.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Better a meaningless name, I should say,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As leaving more to nature and happy chance.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Name children some names and see what you do.</span>
