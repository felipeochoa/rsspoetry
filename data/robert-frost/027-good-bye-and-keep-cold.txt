  <p>
    <span>This saying good-bye on the edge of the dark</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And cold to an orchard so young in the bark</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Reminds me of all that can happen to harm</span>
    <br/>
    <span>An orchard away at the end of the farm</span>
    <br/>
    <span>All winter, cut off by a hill from the house.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I don’t want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I don’t want it dreamily nibbled for browse</span>
    <br/>
    <span>By deer, and I don’t want it budded by grouse.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>(If certain it wouldn’t be idle to call</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I’d summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And warn them away with a stick for a gun.)</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I don’t want it stirred by the heat of the sun.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>(We made it secure against being, I hope,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>By setting it out on a northerly slope.)</span>
    <br/>
    <span>No orchard’s the worse for the wintriest storm;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But one thing about it, it mustn’t get warm.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“How often already you’ve had to be told,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Keep cold, young orchard. Good-bye and keep cold.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Dread fifty above more than fifty below.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I have to be gone for a season or so.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>My business awhile is with different trees,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And such as is done to their wood with an axe⁠—</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Maples and birches and tamaracks.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I wish I could promise to lie in the night</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And think of an orchard’s arboreal plight</span>
    <br/>
    <span>When slowly (and nobody comes with a light)</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Its heart sinks lower under the sod.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But something has to be left to God.</span>
