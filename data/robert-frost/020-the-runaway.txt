  <p>
    <span>Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>We stopped by a mountain pasture to say, “Whose colt?”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and grey,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“I think the little fellow’s afraid of the snow.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He isn’t winter-broken. It isn’t play</span>
    <br/>
    <span>With the little fellow at all. He’s running away.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I doubt if even his mother could tell him, ‘Sakes,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It’s only weather.’ He’d think she didn’t know!</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Where is his mother? He can’t be out alone.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And now he comes again with clatter of stone,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And mounts the wall again with whited eyes</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And all his tail that isn’t hair up straight.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>When other creatures have gone to stall and bin,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Ought to be told to come and take him in.”</span>
