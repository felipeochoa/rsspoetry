    <span>“You know Orion always comes up sideways.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And rising on his hands, he looks in on me</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I should have done by daylight, and indeed,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>After the ground is frozen, I should have done</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To make fun of my way of doing things,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Or else fun of Orion’s having caught me.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights</span>
    <br/>
    <span>These forces are obliged to pay respect to?”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He burned his house down for the fire insurance</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And spent the proceeds on a telescope</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To satisfy a life-long curiosity</span>
    <br/>
    <span>About our place among the infinities.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>“What do you want with one of those blame things?”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I asked him well beforehand. “Don’t you get one!”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“Don’t call it blamed; there isn’t anything</span>
    <br/>
    <span>More blameless in the sense of being less</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A weapon in our human fight,” he said.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“I’ll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span id="the-star-splitter-line-26">There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And plowed between the rocks he couldn’t move</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Trying to sell his farm and then not selling,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He burned his house down for the fire insurance</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And bought the telescope with what it came to.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He had been heard to say by several:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“The best thing that we’re put here for’s to see;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The strongest thing that’s given us to see with’s</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A telescope. Someone in every town</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In Littleton it may as well be me.”</span>
    <br/>
    <span>After such loose talk it was no surprise</span>
    <br/>
    <span>When he did what he did and burned his house down.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Mean laughter went about the town that day</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To let him know we weren’t the least imposed on,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And he could wait⁠—we’d see to him to-morrow.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But the first thing next morning we reflected</span>
    <br/>
    <span>If one by one we counted people out</span>
    <br/>
    <span>For the least sin, it wouldn’t take us long</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To get so we had no one left to live with.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>For to be social is to be forgiving.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>We don’t cut off from coming to church suppers,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But what we miss we go to him and ask for.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He promptly gives it back, that is if still</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It wouldn’t do to be too hard on Brad</span>
    <br/>
    <span>About his telescope. Beyond the age</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of being given one’s gift for Christmas,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He had to take the best way he knew how</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To find himself in one. Well, all we said was</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He took a strange thing to be roguish over.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Some sympathy was wasted on the house,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A good old-timer dating back along;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But a house isn’t sentient; the house</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Didn’t feel anything. And if it did,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Why not regard it as a sacrifice,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Out of a house and so out of a farm</span>
    <br/>
    <span>At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To earn a living on the Concord railroad,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As under-ticket-agent at a station</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Where his job, when he wasn’t selling tickets,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Was setting out up track and down, not plants</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As on a farm, but planets, evening stars</span>
    <br/>
    <span>That varied in their hue from red to green.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>His new job gave him leisure for star-gazing.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Often he bid me come and have a look</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>At a star quaking in the other end.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I recollect a night of broken clouds</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And underfoot snow melted down to ice,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And melting further in the wind to mud.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Bradford and I had out the telescope.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>We spread our two legs as we spread its three,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And standing at our leisure till the day broke,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Said some of the best things we ever said.<a href="#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
    <br/>
    <span>That telescope was christened the Star-splitter,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Because it didn’t do a thing but split</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A star in two or three the way you split</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A globule of quicksilver in your hand</span>
    <br/>
    <span>With one stroke of your finger in the middle.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It’s a star-splitter if there ever was one</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And ought to do some good if splitting stars</span>
    <br/>
    <span>’Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>We’ve looked and looked, but after all where are we?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Do we know any better where we are,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And how it stands between the night to-night</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And a man with a smoky lantern chimney?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>How different from the way it ever stood?</span>
