  <p>
    <span>It is blue-butterfly day here in spring,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry</span>
    <br/>
    <span>There is more unmixed color on the wing</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>But these are flowers that fly and all but sing:</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And now from having ridden out desire</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They lie closed over in the wind and cling</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire.</span>
