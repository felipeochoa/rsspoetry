  <p>
    <span>Why make so much of fragmentary blue</span>
    <br/>
    <span>In here and there a bird, or butterfly,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)⁠—</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Though some savants make earth include the sky;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And blue so far above us comes so high,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>It only gives our wish for blue a whet.</span>
