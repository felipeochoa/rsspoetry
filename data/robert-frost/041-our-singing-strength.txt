  <p>
    <span>It snowed in spring on earth so dry and warm</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The flakes could find no landing place to form.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Hordes spent themselves to make it wet and cold,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And still they failed of any lasting hold.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They made no white impression on the black.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They disappeared as if earth sent them back.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Not till from separate flakes they changed at night</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To almost strips and tapes of ragged white</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Did grass and garden ground confess it snowed,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And all go back to winter but the road.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Next day the scene was piled and puffed and dead.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The grass lay flattened under one great tread.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Borne down until the end almost took root,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The rangey bough anticipated fruit</span>
    <br/>
    <span>With snowballs cupped in every opening bud.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The road alone maintained itself in mud,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Whatever its secret was of greater heat</span>
    <br/>
    <span>From inward fires or brush of passing feet.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>In spring more mortal singers than belong</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To any one place cover us with song.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Thrush, bluebird, blackbird, sparrow, and robin throng;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Some to go further north to Hudson’s Bay,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Some that have come too far north back away,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Really a very few to build and stay.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Now was seen how these liked belated snow.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The fields had nowhere left for them to go;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They’d soon exhausted all there was in flying;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The trees they’d had enough of with once trying</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And setting off their heavy powder load.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They could find nothing open but the road.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>So there they let their lives be narrowed in</span>
    <br/>
    <span>By thousands the bad weather made akin.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The road became a channel running flocks</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of glossy birds like ripples over rocks.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I drove them under foot in bits of flight</span>
    <br/>
    <span>That kept the ground, almost disputing right</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of way with me from apathy of wing,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A talking twitter all they had to sing.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A few I must have driven to despair</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Made quick asides, but having done in air</span>
    <br/>
    <span>A whir among white branches great and small</span>
    <br/>
    <span>As in some too much carven marble hall</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Where one false wing beat would have brought down all,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Came tamely back in front of me, the Drover,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To suffer the same driven nightmare over.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>One such storm in a lifetime couldn’t teach them</span>
    <br/>
    <span>That back behind pursuit it couldn’t reach them;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>None flew behind me to be left alone.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Well, something for a snowstorm to have shown</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The country’s singing strength thus brought together,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>That though repressed and moody with the weather</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Was none the less there ready to be freed</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And sing the wildflowers up from root and seed.</span>
