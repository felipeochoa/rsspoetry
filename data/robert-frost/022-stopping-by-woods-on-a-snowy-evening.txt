  <p>
    <span>Whose woods these are I think I know.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>His house is in the village though;</span>
    <br/>
    <span>He will not see me stopping here</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To watch his woods fill up with snow.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>My little horse must think it queer</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To stop without a farmhouse near</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Between the woods and frozen lake</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The darkest evening of the year.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>He gives his harness bells a shake</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To ask if there is some mistake.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>The only other soundâ€™s the sweep</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Of easy wind and downy flake.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But I have promises to keep,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And miles to go before I sleep,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And miles to go before I sleep.</span>
