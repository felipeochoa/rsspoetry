    <span>They sent him back to her. The letter came</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Saying⁠ ⁠… And she could have him. And before</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She could be sure there was no hidden ill</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Under the formal writing, he was in her sight,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Living. They gave him back to her alive⁠—</span>
    <br/>
    <span>How else? They are not known to send the dead⁠—</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And not disfigured visibly. His face?</span>
    <br/>
    <span>His hands? She had to look, to ask,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>“What is it, dear?” And she had given all</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And still she had all⁠—<em>they</em> had⁠—they the lucky!</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Wasn’t she glad now? Everything seemed won,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And all the rest for them permissible ease.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She had to ask, “What was it, dear?”</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="i14">“Enough,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Yet not enough. A bullet through and through,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>High in the breast. Nothing but what good care</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And medicine and rest, and you a week,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Can cure me of to go again.” The same</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Grim giving to do over for them both.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>She dared no more than ask him with her eyes</span>
    <br/>
    <span>How was it with him for a second trial.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And with his eyes he asked her not to ask.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>They had given him back to her, but not to keep.</span>
