  <p>
    <span>Some say the world will end in fire,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Some say in ice.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I hold with those who favor fire.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>But if it had to perish twice,</span>
    <br/>
    <span>I think I know enough of hate</span>
    <br/>
    <span>To say that for destruction ice</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Is also great</span>
    <br/>
    <span>And would suffice.</span>
